Hey! I’m a cybersecurity student diving into web vulnerabilities, and this portfolio covers how I solved a PortSwigger lab by exploiting a forgeable cookie to access the admin panel and delete "carlos." I used given credentials and tools like Burp Suite to crack this one, super hands-on practice! Here’s the breakdown, with screenshots to show my work, part of my journey to level up in pentesting.

## Lab Overview

- **Goal**: Log in, identify a forgeable cookie, access the admin panel, and delete the user "carlos."
- **Vulnerability**: The admin status is controlled by a cookie that can be manipulated.
## What I Did

1. **Logged In**: Used the provided credentials ("wiener:peter") to log into the website.

	After clicking 'Log in' got home page for user

2. **Inspected the Cookie**: Used Burp Suite’s Proxy or browser dev tools (Cookies section) to inspect the login request. Found a cookie named "admin" set to "false."

1. **Forged the Cookie**: Changed the "admin" cookie value from "false" to "true" using Burp Suite or the browser’s dev tools. This bypassed the access control.

2. **Accessed Admin Panel & Deleted Carlos**: After setting the cookie to "true," I accessed the admin panel and deleted the user "carlos" to complete the lab.

Clicked 'Admin Panel'

Now delete the user 'carlos'

## Skills Learned

- Intercepting and analyzing HTTP requests with Burp Suite.
- Identifying and forging cookies to bypass authentication.
- Understanding insecure session management vulnerabilities.
- Practical web pentesting to escalate privileges.

## Thoughts

This lab was a blast! Switching that cookie from "false" to "true" was like finding the master key, shows how critical secure session handling is. Burp Suite is getting more comfortable, and this builds on my web hacking skills. Ready for more challenges!

## Wrap-Up

Cracked this PortSwigger lab by forging a cookie to access the admin panel and delete "carlos." Excited to keep sharpening my skills! Check my [GitHub](https://github.com/yourusername) for other projects, like my Windows Fundamentals portfolios.
