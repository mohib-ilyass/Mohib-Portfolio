Hey! I’m a cybersecurity student practicing web pentesting, and this portfolio shows how I solved the PortSwigger lab on exploiting admin functionality with an unpredictable URL. The goal was to find and access a hidden admin panel, then delete a user named "carlos". I used tools like Burp Suite and browser dev tools to inspect the source code and uncover the flaw. Here’s what I did, with screenshots to prove my work, part of my journey to build skills and land internships!

## What I Did

- **Lab Setup**: Started with the lab's home page and the task to predict the admin panel's location, access it, and delete the user "carlos".
- **Inspected Source Code**: Used Burp Suite and browser dev tools to view the page source. Found a JavaScript flaw where "admin = false" was set, but it revealed a hidden path like "/admin-y0vefc".
- **Exploited the URL**: Copied the "/admin-****" part and pasted it onto the home page URL (e.g., lab-home-page/admin-y0vefc). This bypassed controls and let me access the admin panel.
    
- **Deleted the User**: Once in the admin panel, I deleted the user "carlos" to solve the lab.
    

## Skills Learned

- Inspecting web source code with Burp Suite and dev tools.
- Identifying JavaScript flaws in access controls.
- Exploiting unpredictable URLs to bypass security.
- Understanding broken access control vulnerabilities.

## Evidence

Here’s a screenshot of the source code showing the hidden admin path:

## Thoughts

This lab was cool! Spotting the admin path in the JavaScript felt like a real "aha" moment. It showed how weak access controls can lead to big breaches. I’m excited to tackle more PortSwigger labs to sharpen my web hacking skills.
